    <h2 id="Buzzcut Season">Buzzcut Season</h2>
    <p>I remember when your head caught flame <br>
      It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain<br>
      (I remember when your head caught flame)<br>
      Well, you laughed, baby, it's okay <br>
      It's buzzcut season anyway <br>
      (Well, you laughed, baby, it's okay)</p>


    <h2 id="Royals">Royals</h2>
    <p>I've never seen a diamond in the flesh <br>
      I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies <br>
      And I'm not proud of my address <br>
      In a torn up town, no postcode envy</p>


    <h2 id="Ribs">Ribs</h2>
    <p>The drink you spilt all over me <br>
      'Lover's Spit' left on repeat <br>
      My mom and dad let me stay home <br>
      It drives you crazy, getting old </p>

    <h2 id="Blue Jeans">Blue Jeans</h2>
    <p>Blue jeans, white shirt <br>
      Walked into the room you know you made my eyes burn <br>
      It was like, James Dean, for sure <br>
      You're so fresh to death and sick as c-cancer</p>

    <h2 id="Summertime Sadness">Summertime Sadness</h2>
    <p>Kiss me hard before you go <br>
      Summertime sadness <br>
      I just wanted you to know <br>
      That baby, you the best</p>

    <h2 id="Young And Beautiful">Young And Beautiful</h2>
    <p>I've seen the world, done it all, had my cake now <br>
      Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now <br>
      Hot summer nights, mid-July <br>
      When you and I were forever wild <br>
      The crazy days, city lights <br>
      The way you'd play with me like a child</p>

      <h2 id="Video Game">Video Game</h2>
      <p>Swinging in the backyard <br>
        Pull up in your fast car <br>
        Whistling my namebr <br>
        Open up a beer <br>
        And you say, "Get over here <br>
        And play a video game"</p>

      <h2 id="Training Wheels">Training Wheels</h2>
      <p>Riding down, riding down <br>
        My hand on your seat <br>
        The whole way 'round <br>
        I carry band-aids on me now <br>
        For when your soft hands hit the jagged ground <br>
        Wheels aren't even touching the ground <br>
        Scared to take them off, but they're so worn down <br>
        Promise I won't push you straight to the dirt <br>
        If you promise me, you'll take them off first</p>

      <h2 id="Pity Party">Pity Party</h2>
      <p>Did my invitations disappear <br>
        Why'd I put my heart on every cursive letter? <br>
        Tell me why the hell no one is here <br>
        Tell me what to do to make it all feel better</p>

      <h2 id="Soap">Soap</h2>
      <p>Think I just remembered something <br>
        I think I left the faucet running <br>
        Now my words are filling up the tub <br>
        Darling, you're just soaking in it <br>
        But I know you'll get out the minute <br>
        You notice all your fingers pruning up</p>
