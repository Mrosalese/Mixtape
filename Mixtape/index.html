    <p>I remember when your head caught flame <br>
      It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain<br>
      (I remember when your head caught flame)<br>
      Well, you laughed, baby, it's okay <br>
      It's buzzcut season anyway <br>
      <br>
      Explosions on TV<br>
      And all the girls with heads inside a dream<br>
      So now we live beside the pool<br>
      Where everything is good<br>
      (Well, you laughed, baby, it's okay)</p>

    <p>I've never seen a diamond in the flesh <br>
      I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies <br>
      And I'm not proud of my address <br>
      In a torn up town, no postcode envy<br>
      <br>
      But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom<br>
      Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room<br>
      We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams<br>
      But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece<br>
      Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash<br>
      We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair<br>

    <p>The drink you spilt all over me <br>
      'Lover's Spit' left on repeat <br>
      My mom and dad let me stay home <br>
      It drives you crazy, getting old <br>
    <br>
    This dream isn't feeling sweet<br>
    We're reeling through the midnight streets<br>
    And I've never felt more alone<br>
    It feels so scary getting old<br>

    <p>Blue jeans, white shirt <br>
      Walked into the room you know you made my eyes burn <br>
      It was like, James Dean, for sure <br>
      You're so fresh to death and sick as c-cancer<br>
      <br>
      You were sorta punk rock,<br>
      I grew up on hip-hop<br>
      But you fit me better<br>
      Than my favourite sweater,<br>
      And I know that love is mean,<br>
      And love hurts<br>
      But I still remember<br>
      That day we met in December,<br>
      Oh, baby!<br>

    <p>Kiss me hard before you go <br>
      Summertime sadness <br>
      I just wanted you to know <br>
      That baby, you the best<br>
      <br>
      I got my red dress on tonight<br>
      Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight<br>
      Done my hair up real big beauty queen style<br>
      High heels off, I'm feeling alive<br>

    <p>I've seen the world, done it all, had my cake now <br>
      Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now <br>
      Hot summer nights, mid-July <br>
      When you and I were forever wild <br>
      The crazy days, city lights <br>
      The way you'd play with me like a child<br>
    <br>
    Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?<br>
    Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?<br>
    I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will<br>
    Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?<br>

      <p>Swinging in the backyard <br>
        Pull up in your fast car <br>
        Whistling my namebr <br>
        Open up a beer <br>
        And you say, "Get over here <br>

      <p>Riding down, riding down <br>
        My hand on your seat <br>
        The whole way 'round <br>
        I carry band-aids on me now <br>
        For when your soft hands hit the jagged ground <br>
        Wheels aren't even touching the ground <br>
        Scared to take them off, but they're so worn down <br>
        Promise I won't push you straight to the dirt <br>
        If you promise me, you'll take them off first<br>
      <br>
      I love everything you do<br>
      When you call me fucking dumb for the stupid shit I do<br>
      I wanna ride my bike with you<br>
      Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you<br>
      I'll pull them off for you<br>
      I love everything you do

      <p>Did my invitations disappear <br>
        Why'd I put my heart on every cursive letter? <br>
        Tell me why the hell no one is here <br>
        Tell me what to do to make it all feel better<br>
      <br>
      Maybe it's a cruel joke on me<br>
      Whatever, whatever<br>
      Just means there's way more cake for me<br>
      Forever, forever

      <p>Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap...<br>
        <br>
        Think I just remembered something <br>
        I think I left the faucet running <br>
        Now my words are filling up the tub <br>
        Darling, you're just soaking in it <br>
        But I know you'll get out the minute <br>
        You notice all your fingers pruning up<br>
        <br>
        I'm tired of being careful, tiptoe, trying to keep the water warm<br>
        Let me under your skin<br>
        Uh-oh, there it goes, I said too much, it overflowed<br>
        Why do I always spill?<br>
